Change Notes: DreamTeam Principles (v 4.1.2 $\to$ v 5.0)

**Release Date:** Dec 15, 2025
**Author:** YURIY TRUKHIN

We are abandoning the "industrial era" paradigm (where people are cogs and success depends on heroism) in favor of **"Quantum Technocracy."**
In v5.0, the focus shifts from hunting for "rock stars" to managing **Cognitive Load** and creating **Flow**. We acknowledge that modern systems are too complex for a single mind, so the team architecture changes from hierarchical to networked (Leaf-Spine).

---

### 1. Decision Making Model: Consensus $\to$ Consent
* **Was (v 4.1.2):** *Consensus*. "We wait until everyone agrees."
* **Now (v 5.0):** *Consent* (Sociocracy). "Is this safe to try?"

**Reason for Change:**
Consensus requires unanimity, which in distributed systems leads to endless meetings and mediocre compromises. We are moving to **Consent** (the absence of paramount objections). This allows for **Bursty iteration**—executing and correcting fast if something goes wrong, rather than endlessly planning for a perfect start.

### 2. New Topology: From Hierarchy to real Leaf-Spine
* **Was:** Classic pyramid with upward escalation.
* **Now:** **Leaf-Spine** Network Structure (based on Team Topologies).

**Reason for Change:**
The old model created bottlenecks at the middle-management level.
* **Leaf:** Stream Engineers delivering value directly. They are autonomous.
* **Spine:** Platform & Leadership. Their role is not to command, but to interconnect and reduce cognitive load for Leaf teams.

Management is no longer "above" engineers; it functions as support infrastructure.

### 3. Leader's Role: "The Shield" & "Stability Island"
* **Was:** Owner—the one who gets "hanged" if the project fails.
* **Now:** Owner is **"The Shield"** (Stability Interface).

**Reason for Change:**
Engineers in a deep flow state are emotionally vulnerable. The leader's task is not just to answer for results, but to absorb external entropy and chaos, creating an "island of stability" for the team.
* **Principle:** *Public Liability, Private Correction*. The leader publicly takes the blame ("I am to blame"), but privately demands strict accountability.

---

### 4. Transparency: Level 3 Visibility
* **Was:** Green/Red reports, general status updates.
* **Now:** **Open Order Book**.

**Reason for Change:**
Adopting the Financial Markets metaphor (Level 3 Market Data). We no longer believe in aggregated reports ("traffic lights") which often hide the truth. We open the "raw data": queue sizes, blockers, decision history. Transparency is the antidote to office politics.

### 5. Culture & HR: The Keeper Test instead of "Family"
* **Was:** We are different, we do the impossible, respect is the default.
* **Now:** We are a **Professional Sports Team**, not a family. Introducing **The Keeper Test**.

**Reason for Change:**
Borrowed from Netflix culture. Talent has a tendency to dilute.
* **The Question:** *“If this employee told you they were leaving for a competitor, would you fight hard to keep them?”*
* If the answer is **"No"**—we pay a generous severance and say goodbye.

**Talent Density** is more important than comfort. Toxicity now includes **Ruinous Empathy**—failing to tell a colleague about their mistakes to avoid "hurting their feelings."

---

### 6. Metrics: From Lines of Code to DORA
* **Was:** Vague goals ("achieve big things without breaking").
* **Now:** Strict **DORA Metrics** (DevOps Research and Assessment).

**Reason for Change:**
Scientific research proves that speed and stability are not trade-offs. We measure:
1.  **Deployment Frequency** (How often we ship).
2.  **Lead Time for Changes** (Time from commit to production).
3.  **Time to Restore** (Fixing speed).
4.  **Change Failure Rate** (Percentage of failures).
