# The DreamTeam Principles
*Created by **YURIY TRUKHIN** — v 5.0*

> *<The previous content was removed. We don’t need industrial-era management for quantum-era problems.>*

We are the team that will make our company **No. 1**. The industrial era is over; we don't treat people like cogs. We operate as a high-frequency organism, valuing **Radical Visibility** and **Cognitive Flow** above all else.

We don’t spell out the lowest bar of rules that’ll get you fired. Instead, we set **incredibly high standards** (Talent Density) and hire exceptional people who value autonomy.
We never drop a task until it’s done—but we prioritize **speed** because speed creates stability. We want teammates who drive the right things and act with **Ethical Autonomy**, building only what they believe in.

**Flow**—and the initiative to remove blockers—always comes first. Even better if you build the **Product** that makes the improvement automatic.

## Horizontal Team (Consent > Consensus)

- **No bosses; only Consent.**
  We do not wait for *Consensus* (everyone agrees), which breeds mediocrity. We operate on **Consent**: *"Is this safe to try?"* If there is no paramount objection—no evidence of immediate harm—we execute. **Bursty iteration** beats slow perfection.

- **The Arbitrator Protocol.**
  If two people jam (normal in distributed systems), call in an *arbitrator*—not a "boss", but the person with the deepest domain competence.
  > *“An arbitrator might choose something you don’t like. Suck it up and commit.”*

- **Bubble-up Escalation.**
  Decisions happen at the **Leaf** level (where the code is). Escalate only to unblock.
  1. Stream Owner
  2. Product Owner
  3. ...Higher-level decisions only address shared scope, then **bubble back down**.

**Consent lets us be smarter (and faster) than our competitor’s smartest bureaucracy.**

## Leaf–Spine Team Topology

We don’t blur responsibility. We manage **Cognitive Load**, not people.

| Role | What It Means (The Truth) |
|-----|-----|
| **Stream Engineer** | The core unit (Leaf). You deliver value directly to the user. You "Build It and Run It"—but only because the Platform makes running it easy. |
| **Tech Lead** | A **Bar Raiser**. Independent force who ensures technical excellence and **Flow**. They have no HR power, only the Authority of Competence. |
| **Owner (The Shield)** | The **Stability Interface**. Their job is to absorb the entropy (chaos) from the business so the team can focus. They stand before the board and say **“I am to blame”** for failures, but privately they demand accountability. |
| **Director of Department** | Gets "hanged" if the internal product fails to support the Leafs. Steers long-term tech strategy to reduce cognitive load. |

## Radical Visibility

We reject "Green/Red" status reports — they are lies.
We operate with an **Open Order Book**.
- We show the raw data: the blockers, the queue sizes, the specific "why" behind decisions.
- **Transparency is the antidote to politics.** If the data is visible, the "shadow agendas" die.

---

## Who’s the Most Important?

All **Engineers and SREs** who are in the "Flow."
Above them are only our users (who pay our salaries).
**Management exists solely to serve as a support function for Engineering.** If a manager isn't removing a blocker or absorbing stress (The Shield), they are overhead.

---

## Vital Signs (Key Goals)

Forget "Lines of Code". We watch the **DORA Metrics**:
1. **Deployment Frequency** (On-demand)
2. **Lead Time for Changes** (Hours, not weeks)
3. **Time to Restore** (Fix it fast)
4. **Change Failure Rate** (Don't break it often)

Achieving big targets **without breaking things** secures the company’s future. Speed and Stability are friends, not enemies.

> *From each according to ability, to each according to opportunity.*

---

## The "Keeper" Standard

We are a **Pro Team**, not a family.
**The Test:** *"If a team member told you they were leaving for a competitor, would you fight hard to keep them?"*
If the answer is **No**—we give them a generous severance and say goodbye immediately. **Talent Density** is our oxygen.

## Toxicity Is Evil! (But Silence is Worse)

- **Psychological Safety != Comfort.** It means it is safe to take risks and safe to speak up.
- **Radical Candor:** We care personally, so we **challenge directly**. Ruinous empathy is a fireable offense.
- **Public Liability, Private Correction:** If code breaks, the Team/Lead takes the blame publicly. Inside, we fix the process instantly.
- Any junior can tell a Lead they are wrong—but must argue with data in chat.
- We drop honorifics. **Respect is the default.**

---

## The Prime Directive

> **Don’t do stupid stuff**; act so you won’t feel ashamed before users, colleagues, or your future self reading this legacy code.

Know why you earned your salary today. Systems this complex—and a **Dream Team**—can be built only together.

**P.S.** What happens for breaking the rules? *\\*ties a lynch knot murmuring “sociocracy, sociocracy”\\** 😉 Just kidding.
Rules are written—and updated—collectively based on data. **Pull Requests welcome!**
