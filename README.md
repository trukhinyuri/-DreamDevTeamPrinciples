# DevTeam Principles – The Manifesto  
*Created by **YURIY TRUKHIN**, Nov 2013 — Edition v 4.1.2*

> *<The previous content was removed as demotivating bureaucratic nonsense>*

We are the team that will make our company **No. 1**—and we’re unlike anyone else. Because we’re different, we do what others won’t and some deem impossible. We don’t spell out the lowest bar of rules that’ll get you fired ((c) Elon Musk). Instead, we set **incredibly high standards** and hire exceptional people who love pushing their limits every day.  
We never drop a task until it’s done—no matter how hard it is—and that’s how we grow. We want teammates who drive the right things and act with integrity even when no one is watching.

Knowledge—and the initiative to make things better—always comes first. Even better if you both **propose** and **deliver** the improvement.

## Horizontal Team

- **No bosses; only consensus.**  
  If two people can’t agree (normal in distributed systems), call in an *arbitrator* from the horizontal team—someone who lives by these principles, knows the domain deeply, and is trusted by everyone affected. The arbitrator cannot override the consensus rule.

- **Bubble‑up escalation.**  
  If consensus still fails, escalate upward through each shared‑responsibility layer:
    1. Project owner
    2. Owner of the broader area (if multiple teams)
    3. …and so on, until a common owner is found.  
       Higher‑level decisions address only their shared scope, then **bubble back down** so each lower scope can implement them with full awareness of downstream impact.

> “It’s better to agree horizontally” — *Alexey Gadalin, Sr Manager AWS EC2*  
> (An arbitrator might choose something you don’t like — *Yan Leshchinsky, founder Yandex.Cloud, VP AWS*.)

Discuss potentially contentious issues in **team chats**, not private messages—colleagues can step in as spontaneous arbitrators.

**Consensus lets us be smarter together than our competitor’s smartest employee and avoid their mistakes.**

## Leaf–Spine Team Structure

We don’t blur responsibility inside **#DEVteam**.

| Role | What It Means |
|-----|-----|
| **Tech Lead** | Independent, respected dev who’s delivered a lot solo, helps others grow, and has great hard & soft skills. Many can exist; it’s not an HR title. |
| **Owner** | The person who gets “hanged” if the project fails (often called Team Lead or TPO). Owns the entire product, team processes, backlog, and external communication. |
| **Director of Development** | Gets “hanged” if *any* dev product fails. Steers long‑term tech strategy and empowers teams through **non‑violent leadership**. |

## Who’s the Most Important?

All **developers, DevOps/SREs, and engineers** who do the work. Above them are only our users—after all, **they pay our salaries**.

---

## Key Goals

Organizational strategy → Department goals → Development‑division goals, all filtered through our long‑term tech strategy. Achieving big targets **without breaking things** secures the company’s future.

> *From each according to ability, to each according to opportunity.*

Customers see *one organism*; a strong heart is useless if the liver fails.

## About Titles

Forget them—they never keep up with reality.

## Toxicity Is Evil!

- Any junior or tech lead can tell you you’re doing nonsense—but must argue publicly in chat.
- Great ideas come from any level and matter equally.
- We drop honorifics, gender, age, credentials, etc. Everyone’s opinion counts and **respect is the default**.
- If code is bad, we fix it—writer *or* reviewer can err.
- Arbitrators help if needed, but listening is better.

## The Prime Directive

> **Don’t do stupid stuff**; act so you won’t feel ashamed before users, colleagues, or descendants.

Know why you earned your salary today. Systems this complex—and a **Dream Team**—can be built only together.

**P.S.** What happens for breaking the rules? *\\*ties a lynch knot murmuring “democracy, democracy”\\** 😉 Just kidding. Rules are written—and updated—collectively. **Feedback welcome!**
